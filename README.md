## General info

This is my project submission for my Shopify Frontend Engineer Internship Summer of 2022 application. Ran into a few gotchas of course, maily in that the APOD is sometimes a video :) However, not such a big deal. I made it work by conditionally rendering a youtube iframe if the media type was video.
